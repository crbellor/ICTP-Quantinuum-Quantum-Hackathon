The challenge is focused on modelling catalytic processes in Hydrogen fuel cells. The motivation is to model one of the key steps in the oxygen reduction reaction. 

To being on this challenge, you all can have a read of the following blog: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/quantum-computing/exploring-computational-chemistry-using-quantinuums-inquanto-on-aws/


In the challenge, We begin with analysing the chemical system's molecular orbitals, molecular orbitals energy, and density matrix.

System: Pt5 + O2

Learning tasks: 
Tasks 1: 
a). Run the Pt5 + O2 calculation using inquanto and pyscf library 
b). Plot the MOs
c). List of occupation numbers for ten orbitals (5 highly filled in energy, five lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals) 


Challenge tasks: 
Task 2: 

 a). Localisation scheme of molecular orbitals 
  
Task 3: 

 a). Perform transformation of molecular Hamiltonian to quantum JW basis 
 b). Choose and run VQE ansatz from Inquanto 
 c). test different flavour of VQE ansatz and compare the results 
 
 
 Task 4: 
 
 a). Come up with a solution to reduce the complexity of ansatz based on symmetry (such as point group symmetry)  
 
 
 Task 5: 
 
 a). Explore the Potential energy surface with respect to Pt-O bond distance (Dissociation occurs when the bond is too elongated)
 b). Come up with techniques to converge calculation for elongated bonds (in case the standard settings for calculation fail)
